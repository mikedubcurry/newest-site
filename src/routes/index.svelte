	<h1>Welcome</h1>
	<p>
		My name is Michael, I work full time writing JavaScript applications at Atlas Copco. Outside of
		work I like to discover new JavaScript frameworks as well as try to master CSS. When I'm not
		coding, I can be found tending to my garden, playing guitar in a band with my friends, or riding
		my motorcycle.
	</p>
	<p>
		My goal for this website is to have it be a centralized location for my writings and act as a
		testing-ground of sorts for different tech I'm currently learning.
