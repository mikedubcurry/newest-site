# Growing Peppers

Last year I had a small garden of kale and other leafy greens in our backyard. They were pretty easy to grow, really only requiring water every morning. Abount halfway through the season, we cooked a dinner that used bell peppers and were left with a ton of seeds on the counter. Thinking ahead, I grabbed most of them and stashed them in an envelope. It was too late to grow them at that point and didn't have space in my office for an indoor plant since I had a large basil plant (bush) growing. So I waited until the next year to plant them. 

***FLASH FORWARD TO APRIL 2021***

This year, having some experience planting seeds, I wanted to grow on a larger scale, with more diverse crops. I had all the different lettuce-type plants (different kales, arugala, and others), two kinds of tomato, beet, carrot, radish, and my pepper seeds. I unknowingly jumped the gun by a few weeks and started all my seeds indoors inside old papper coffee cups. Each cup got three seeds which would be thinned down to one per cup. After a few weeks, all of my cups had a healthy seedling, eager to be transplated and soak up the sun. The problem was that it was still April, and still very cold outside. I ended up waiting one week more until the first weekend of May, after which i moved all my plants to the backyard. Over night, all but the kale had withered up. Lucky for me I had another batch of seedlings growing inside so it wasn't a total loss. After doing my due dilligence and waiting for the frost to pass, I moved that batch of plants outside and they are thriving!

My peppers are a different story... At this point I only had three pepper seedlings. My garden was full of mostly kale and a few tomato plants, so I could only move two peppers outside. I kept one inside in case space cleared up in the future. Sadly, the outdoor peppers succumbed to "Squirrel-Bite-Fever" and didn't last a week. I decided to keep my last pepper plant inside.

Just last week, at the end of July, I harvested two red-orange peppers and still have a ton of flowers fruting.

# Why Indoors?

I decided to keep my plant indoors mostly because it reduces the amount of variables at play in determining a successful grow. I don't have to worry about rain/drought, squirrels, or bugs as much. I also have two LED grow lights set to a timer so I can maximize the amount of light the plant receives. I can also cheat and start growing earlier than I can outside. I had planned on wiring up a moisture sensor to a raspberry pi to alert me if I need to water the plant, but I decided to save that project for next season. 

My partner already has a ton of house plants inside, so why not grow a crop or two as well? Occasionally if she neglects a plant for too long and it starts to wither, I'll be given custody and rehabilitate it back to good order, since my grow lights cover a large area, I usually have plenty of room.

# Outcome

Like I said, I just harvested two peppers from my indoor plant a couple weeks ago and they were amazing! I used some compost from a local supplier to supply the plant's nutrients and consitently watered it whenever the soil demanded moisture. Recently however, I noticed the leaves yellowing so I deduced it was running out of plant food. I decided to move it to a larger pot and found it to be root bound, no wonder why it was needing water every day...

After transplanting it, the leaves greened up again and it started producing buds once again, many of which are starting to fruit! I think I'll be able to get another harvest out of my plant before it gets too cold and the air dries out. I learned a lot this season and plan on iterating and improving next year. Hopefully I can figure out a squirrel solution so I can leave some plants outside. 


Thanks for reading! I'm still only starting my habit of writing and don't want to only write about JavaScript so hopefully I can write more about other topics like this in the future.
